## üß† Overview

The **Auto-Grind Config System** operates through a modular task loop that reads your desired grind area, timing, and behavior values. Using real-time telemetry, it adjusts movements, attacks, and item pickups according to monster density and loot weight.

You can fine-tune **speed**, **route length**, **combat aggression**, and **return intervals** ‚Äî giving you total control over how long you grind and how you recover.

[!NOTE]
This configuration system is external and user-controlled. It‚Äôs designed for **optimization**, not server manipulation or illegal modification.
